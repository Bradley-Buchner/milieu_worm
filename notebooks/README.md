# *Mutual Interactors* for *C. elegans* aging: discovering novel gene-lifespan associations and quantifying aging-specific importance

**Bradley Buchner**

This subdirectory contains Jupyter notebooks that repurpose the *Mutual Interactors* framework for the discovery of phenotype associations in the *C. elegans* genetic interaction network. Specifically, the notebook `milieu_worm_walkthrough.ipynb` takes you through the process of training a model on the *C. elegans* network, performing node-set expansion of lifespan-associated nodes, and computing an aging importance metric, which quantifies a node's influence as a mutual interactor in node-set expansion of lifespan-associated nodes.

To train a model, the following inputs are required: (1) the organism's full genetic and molecular interaction network as a graph with 11,513 nodes (genes/proteins) and 84,667 edges (interactions), and (2) a collection of 694 different biological processes in *C. elegans* and the genes known to be associated with them, including the process of aging (a.k.a. the GO term "determination of adult lifespan"). Using these inputs, *Mutual Interactors* is able to infer phenotype-gene associations at a level that is significantly better than a randomized model. Specifically, the model is able to recover held-out proteins and reconstruct node sets at a high rate, scoring 30.4% of held-out positives in the top 25 of predictions for phenotypes that the model did not see during training (recall-at-25 = 30.4). This is shown in the notebook `milieu_worm_walkthrough.ipynb`.

Also shown in `milieu_worm_walkthrough.ipynb` is the process of calculating gene aging importance. This importance score is computed by integrating the model’s learned global interactor weights—which represent a node's general capacity to carry phenotypic signal across the network—with its specific connectivity to known lifespan-associated nodes. By identifying nodes that act as powerful mutual interactors for the aging phenotype, the framework can uncover genes that may have been overlooked by traditional direct-interaction analysis.

Ultimately, `milieu_worm_walkthrough.ipynb` serves as an example of how to extend the *Mutual Interactors* framework to address more targeted research questions.
